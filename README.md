# Background

This repository is for data structure and programming. The availability of AI coding assistants has made programming a vanishing art. CEOs of
almost all AI tech companies predict that AI coding assistants will do 50-90% of the coding. Those who want to prioritize 
coding as a career option should instead train in AI-ML, deep learning, and robotics. However, there are many others, like Linux OS creator
Linus Torvalds believes understanding data structures and having a strong background in programming is very important. He says bad 
programmers worry about code, and good programmers worry about data structures. Torvalds sees great potential for AI coding assistants to 
review codes rather than write coding. My views are similar to those of Linus Torvalds. Code maintenance is a big issue in software 
solutions, especially in case it is for an AI tool. Code maintenance will be a big issue if we increasingly rely on AI coding 
assistants to write codes for software solutions.
