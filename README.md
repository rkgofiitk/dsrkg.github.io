# Data Structure Using Python

This repository is for programs learning Data Structure. Though AI code assistant has made coding easy. Learning to write and understand
Data Structure and Programming remains an important aspect of training in Computer Science. The coding assistant will not teach you
how to program,but will generate code when you ask correct questions. If questions are not precise the coding assistants like any other
programmer end up generation useless code. Apart from the issue of preciseness of prompting, AI coding assistant may sometime offer
explanations without much clarity. Data Structure is one of the core subjects of computer science course. It deals with organization of
data so that the performance of programs is not affected due to storing and retrieving of data. Visualize a large warehouse of a 
logistic movement company. If the warehouse is not properly organized or the objects are stored orderly, movement of goods is affected.
Similarly, if the data obects with linear relationships is mixed up with data objects with nonlineaar relationships then the latency of
both retrieval and storing for any specific data object becomes long. So, the performance of a program becomes an issue. Therefore,
learning and understanding Data Structure is very critical. Programming is not very essential to understanding principles behind 
structuring of data. However, the role algorihm is crucial, because it determines both complexity and performance. In this repository
we intent to focus on these aspects and provide tkinter gui based Python programs for important Data Structures.
