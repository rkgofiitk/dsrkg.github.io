# Background

This repository is for data structure and programming. The availability of AI coding assistants has turned programming into a vanishing art. 
CEOs of almost all AI tech companies predict that AI coding assistants will do 50-90% of the coding tasks. Those who want to prioritize 
coding as a career option should instead train in AI-ML, deep learning, and robotics. However, there are many others, like Linux OS creator
Linus Torvalds believes understanding data structures and having a strong background in programming is very important. He says bad 
programmers worry about code, and good programmers worry about data structures. AI coding assistants may pick up the most 
efficient data structure for an application. It requires the coding assistant to have sufficient knowledge of algorithm efficiency,
coding, and data structures. Torvalds sees great potential for AI coding assistants to review codes rather than write coding. My views are
similar to those of Linus Torvalds. Code maintenance is another difficulty for coding assistants in successfully replacing human coders.  
Code maintenance is a big issue in software solutions, especially in case it is for an AI tool. It could be a problematic issue if we 
increasingly rely on AI coding assistants to write codes for software solutions.
